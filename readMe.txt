This is a github for Christopher Nguyen's google sheet stock trading barometer and associated scripts.
Everything in barometerScripts.js should be copied into the script editor of a barometer sheet.
My personal barometer is at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pX6XWX6az-ED-v3-iMvRMeSu9BqvfYvhjMODQodoD5g/edit?usp=sharing.

Trading is an art, but I like to think of it as a bunch of sensible things that make nonsense.
